### Introduction

Hi! My name is Peter and I'm a **junior** at UCSD studying Math-CS. 
Currently, I'm working part-time as a __Student Software Engineer__ at the IT services team to help modernize academic provisioning processes. I'm really excited to learn more about Software Engineering in this course!

> I'm crazy about everything data
I discovered my interest in optimizing software and data driven projects as I am eager to work with Software Infrastructure, Cloud Technology and Data Engineering.

### Tech Stuff

Below is a review of the general Git workflow:
```
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin main
```

Here is a [link to my profile](https://github.com/peterjhyoon).

The top 3 things that I'm excited about in this course are:
1. Learning the fundamentals of Software Engineering
2. Meeting and learning from the teaching staff and other students
3. Creating an exciting project!

Some of the backend tech stack I have experience with are:
* FastAPI
* Django
* MySQL
* AWS
